Module in named `interpolation` and is stored in `/interpolation` folder. It provides a class `RegularGrid`and classes that implement interpolation algorithms. 

A description of the currently implemented algorithms is contained in the section "Implemented algorithms".

Also you can run script that resizes images. Use `poetry run resize`. Usage:
.. code-block:: console
    Usage: resize [OPTIONS] INPUT_PATH OUTPUT_PATH
    
      Change image size using interpolation
    
    Options:
      --width INTEGER         Target width in pixels
      --height INTEGER        Target height in pixels
      --algorithm [bilinear]  [default: bilinear]
      --help                  Show this message and exit.

Here is an example of image resizing from size $300 \times 300$ to $600 \times 600$:
